Scripts used to modify the ROM as well as certain modified files created for work-in-progress builds will be included here so my process can be recreated.

The version number (e.g. "0.2.0") indicates what work-in-progress version the file was created at - see readme in the main directory.

".xsc" files are scripts for use with XVI32 for mass find+replace-ing sprite pointers.

Included here:
  - System files or other files with special manual edits
  - Scripts to run on individual localized stage files to replace sprite pointers

Not included here:
  - All the edited localized stage files
  - The rest of the ROM
