An initial version of the "NG+ Mode" visual hack for Ghost Trick is out! Download the patch here: https://github.com/ArcanaXIX/GhostTrickNGPlus/tree/main/Release

**SPOILERS BELOW - PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK**

v1.0.0 constitutes:
  - Every single portrait sprite for Sissel, both ghost and human, has been replaced with the appropriate cat portrait.
  - The image of Yomiel's corpse in the directory entry for Sissel has been replaced with an animation of the cat.
  - CURRENTLY ONLY IMPLEMENTED IN ENGLISH.

Current roadmap for future updates, as time/interest allows:
  - Update the "trick" and "swap to Sissel from Missile" button icons to display a cat.
    (Courtesy of MLC, the assets are ready; implementing them will be the difficult part.)

Very "Nice-to-Haves" that are high-level and unlikely to happen, but might be cool someday:
  - Additional portrait expressions for the cat.
  - A button or mechanism to toggle "Cat Mode" on/off.
  - Implement changes in other languages.
    (This may conflict with the idea of using a different language as a "Cat Mode" toggle. TBD.)
  - Introduce different portrait expressions for the small talk sprites.
    (These exist in the game's visual code, but are unused and would be difficult to hook up.)

All future releases will be pushed to the "Release" directory.
Source code, scripts, and a changelog if you are interested in replicating or adding to my work can be found at the "ResourceFiles" directory.
